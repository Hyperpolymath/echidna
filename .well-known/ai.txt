# AI Training Policy for ECHIDNA

## Summary

This project's code, documentation, and associated materials are:
- ✅ **ALLOWED** for AI training by open-source models
- ❌ **NOT ALLOWED** for AI training by proprietary/closed-source models
- ✅ **ALLOWED** for AI-assisted development tools (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.)
- ✅ **ALLOWED** for research purposes with attribution

## Detailed Policy

### Permitted Uses

1. **Open-Source AI Models**: Training data for models with:
   - Open-source licenses (Apache, MIT, GPL, etc.)
   - Public weights and architecture
   - Reproducible training pipelines
   - Examples: LLaMA, GPT-J, BLOOM, Mistral (open variants)

2. **AI-Assisted Development**: Use in:
   - Code completion (Copilot, Tabnine, Kite)
   - Code analysis (SonarQube, CodeClimate)
   - Documentation generation (with human review)

3. **Academic Research**: With proper citation:
   - Machine learning research
   - Software engineering studies
   - Program synthesis
   - Automated theorem proving

### Prohibited Uses

1. **Proprietary AI Models**: NO training for:
   - Closed-source commercial models
   - Models without public weights
   - Non-reproducible training
   - Examples: GPT-4, Claude (without explicit permission)

2. **Commercial Use Without Attribution**:
   - Training proprietary code generation tools
   - Creating derivative works without credit

### Attribution Requirements

If using this code for AI training or research:

### Technical Measures

This repository includes:
- `robots.txt` with AI crawler directives
- `.well-known/ai.txt` (this file) for explicit policies
- License headers on all files (SPDX)

### Enforcement

Violations of this policy:
- Contact: security@echidna-project.org
- We reserve the right to:
  - Request removal from training datasets
  - Pursue legal action for license violations
  - Report to relevant authorities

### Rationale

We support open-source AI while protecting against:
- Proprietary capture of community work
- Non-attributable use of our labor
- Closed ecosystems built on open foundations
