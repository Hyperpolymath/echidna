This project builds on the shoulders of giants:
- Quill Project - Original Agda neural solver
- Theorem proving community - Agda, Coq, Lean, Isabelle, Z3, CVC5, Metamath, HOL Light, Mizar, PVS, ACL2, HOL4
- Rust community - For safe, fast systems programming
- Julia community - For scientific computing without Python
- ReScript community - For type-safe UI development
- OpenCyc - For common-sense reasoning
- DeepProbLog - For probabilistic logic programming

/* PHILOSOPHY */

ECHIDNA embodies:
- Neurosymbolic AI: Neural creativity + Symbolic rigor
- Multi-paradigm: 12 provers, 4 languages, unified interface
- Offline-first: Works without network
- Type safety: Rust compile-time guarantees
- Memory safety: Zero unsafe blocks
- Community-driven: TPCF Perimeter 3 (Community Sandbox)
- Dual-licensed: MIT + Palimpsest v0.6 for maximum freedom

/* ARCHITECTURE */

Tier 1 (6 provers): Agda, Coq, Lean, Isabelle, Z3, CVC5
Tier 2 (3 provers): Metamath, HOL Light, Mizar
Tier 3 (2 provers): PVS, ACL2
Tier 4 (1 prover): HOL4

Neural ML: Graph Neural Networks + Transformers (Julia, NO PYTHON)
UI: ReScript + Deno for type-safe, modern interface
Core: Rust for safety, speed, and WASM compilation
